\description{
This function makes all pairwise/ setwise combinations of sites in the community matrix x and calculates pairwise/ setwise beta diversities,
respectively. "Set" refers to a user-defined number of samples that will be used. This is essentially
the number of plots in a sample-based rarefaction. It's default is 2 (i.e. pairs).
}
\details{
The calulation of the beta-diversity metric is done according to the function in "func". This should be a function that returns a
(dis-)similarity or beta diversity metric for a site-by species matrix like x. "func" is applied to every subset. Addidtional arguments will be passed on to "func".

If the number of possible sets/ pairwise comparisons exceeds the value of max_combn. A random subsample of all combinations will
be drawn. The number of random samples can be adjusted using the argument resamples. It is not recommended increase the
value of max_combn. The function choose() "n over k" can be used to manually compute the number of possible subsets where
n is the number of samples/rows in x and k is setsize. If summarise = T, mean and variance of all setwise
comparisons are returned. Otherwise, the function returns all individual beta values.

The default value for setsize is 2 which means that pairwise beta diversities are returned.
Pairwise beta_Sn values are independent of the gamma_scale diversity and sampling effort.
Therefore, they allow for meaningfull comparisons between groups with different numbers of
samples (see Marion et al, 2017).
