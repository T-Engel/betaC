\title{Calculate the recommended maximum coverage value for the computation of beta_C from a site by species matrix}
\usage{
C_target(x, factor = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a site by specie matrix}

\item{factor}{numeric. how far}
}
\value{
numeric value
}
\description{
This returns the coverage of x at the gamma scale that corresponds to the smalles observed sample size at the alpha scale times an extrapolation factor.
The default (factor = 2) allows for extrapolation up to 2 times the observed sample size of the smallest alpha sample. For factor= 1, only interpolation is applied.
its not recommendable to use factors largers than 2.
