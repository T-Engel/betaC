\title{Calculate beta_C}
\usage{
beta_C(x, C, extrapolation = T, interrupt = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a site by species matrix}

\item{C}{target coverage. value between 0 and 1.}

\item{extrapolation}{logical. should extrapolation be used?}

\item{interrupt}{logical. SHould the function throw an error when C exceeds the maximum recommendable coverage?}
}
\value{
a numeric value
}
\description{
Beta_C uses coverage-based rarefaction to quantify the non-random component in beta-diversity.
The partitioning is done at the number of individuals that corresponds to a sample coverage of C at the gamma scale.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
library(vegan)
data(BCI)

# What is beta_C for a coverage value of 60\%?
beta_C(BCI,C = 0.6)
}
}
