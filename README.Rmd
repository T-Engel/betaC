# About betaC

This r package "betaC" accompanies the following manuscript preprinted on [biorxiv](https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.14.040402v1):

**Engel T., Blowes, S. A. McGlinn, D. J., May, F., Gotelli, N. J, McGill, B. J., Chase, J. M. (2020). Resolving the species pool dependence of beta-diversity using coverage-based rarefaction. bioRxiv 2020.04.14.040402; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.040402**


## Objectives

The r package and this repository have two main objectives:

1. To provide easy tools for the calculation of beta_C, a metric that quantifies the non-random component in beta-diversity for a given sample completeness.

2. To share the simulation code and results that we use in our above-mentioned paper. You can find them in the folder [Simulations](https://github.com/T-Engel/betaC/tree/master/Simulations).

## Installation

You can install the development version of the package "betaC" from [GitHub](https://github.com/T-Engel/betaC) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("T-Engel/betaC")
```
Please, also install the package "vegan" from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("vegan")
```

Furthermore, "tidyverse" is recommended but the main functions will work without it.

## Short summary

betaC is a beta-diversity index that measures intraspecific spatial aggregation or species turnover in space independently of the size of the regional species pool. This is important because most beta-diversity metrics don't only respond to the spatial structure of species diversity in an area but also to the total number of species occurring there. So, high beta-diversity can mean that there is a strong spatial clumping of species and/or that there is just a high gamma diversity. People have tried to disentangle these effects with mixed results.

In our paper we make the argument that the species-pool dependence of beta-diversity is linked sampling effects. Sampling effects arises because alpha and gamma scale diversity estimates are by definition based on very different sample sizes (i.e.,  numbers of individuals captured by a sample). This means that a major part of beta diversity is usually due to a more-individuals effect between alpha and gamma scales and not due to spatial structure. The strength of this sampling effect is stronger in large species pools where sampling curves are typically very steep (i.e. there is a larger jump from alpha to gamma). The steepness of sampling curves is related to sample completeness. We find that by standardizing beta-diversity by sample completeness, we remove the sampling effect and the resulting metric, betaC only responds to spatial aggregation.

To achieve this, we use a combination of individual-based and coverage-based rarefaction (coverage is a measure of sample completeness). The main idea of our approach is that within a species pool alpha and gamma scale diversity estimates are standardized to a common number of individuals, while across species pools we allow the sample size to vary in order to keep a constant gamma-scale sample sample coverage (*C*) instead.


## Main functions of this package
If you've read the paper and you just want to have the code to calculate beta_C, here is all you need to know:

* The main function of this package is `beta_C()`. Its first argument `x` takes a site-by-species abundance matrix as a matrix object or data frame (sites=rows, species= rows). The second argument `C` is the target coverage used for standardization. The function returns beta_C as a numeric value. As a default extrapolation is used but you can also change this using the argument `extrapolation` Type `?beta_C` to see the documentation.

* The other important function is `C_target(x)`. Its fits argument `x` is a site-by-species abundance matrix. It returns the maximum possible coverage value that can be used to calculate beta_C for the community matrix `x`. As a default it allows for extrapolation, i.e. it will extrapolate to a sample size that exceeds the smallest sample size by a factor 2. You can also adjust this extrapolation factor through the argument `factor`(e.g. `factor = 1` for interpolation only). However, we caution against values larger than 2. When comparing beta_C across multiple communities with changing species pools, it is recommended to choose the `C` argument  in `beta_C(x, C)`such that it corresponds to the smallest `C_target()` output of all the communities. Type `?C_target` to see the documentation.
